# \[Standard\] What is a good algorithm implementation ticket

**Algorithm performance is not a validation criteria**

On our first machine learning project, we had a Product Owner dissatisfied because we told him that a new model \(histogram of colors\) would outperform a previous one.  
We implemented the ticket and the result was worse.  
Our client thought we did something wrong, doubted our implementation and was disappointed.

**We cannot know in advance the result of an algorithm.  
If we knew, we would not implement it.**

However, algorithm performances must be explained to the Product Owner.

## Standard

### Definition of Done

* I understood and explained, face to face if needed or by phone, to the product owner the algorithm performances.
* Validation time is between 5 and 10 minutes

### Definition of Ready

* I took into account the time necessary for result analysis.
* I took into account the time necessary to explain the result to the Product Owner.
