# \[Standard\] What is a good algorithm investigation ticket

## Definition of Done

* I understood and explained, face to face if needed or by phone, to the product owner:
  * how the algorithm works
  * why the algorithm works in our case
  * which parameters you choose and why
  * what are the pros and cons
* I know the cost:
  * how much time we need to implement it?
  * how much time we need for training?
  * do we have the data - cleaned, labeled?
