# \[Standard\] Machine Learning Sprint duration

## Standard

A machine learning sprint lasts half a week \(if team is full-time\).  
There are 2 ceremonies per week that last at most 2h each.

## Why

On our first computer vision project for our second sprint planning, we planned a 2 days investigation because we could not go further.  
Our plan did not enable us to parallelize algorithm tests, and we could not implement algorithms before investigating on their complexity.
