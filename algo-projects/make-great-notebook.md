# How to make a great notebook

### Owner: Alexandre Chaintreuil

## Why

A challenge of algo projects is to give visibility to the client. The client is often not technical and may have a hard time understanding what we do. It is our job to make it as easy as possible.

We found that notebooks are a great way to explain what we do during investigation.

## Control Points

- [ ] I have simple graphics
  - [ ] The graphic has a title
  - [ ] The graphic should be easy to understand (check with your Agile coach for example)
- [ ] If possible, I show intermediates steps
- [ ] If possible, I show counter-examples
