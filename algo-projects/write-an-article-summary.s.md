# \[Standard\] How to write a scientific article summary

### Owner: [Alexandre Chaintreuil](https://github.com/achntrl)

## Why

When working on algorithm, you will probably have to read scientific articles. The best way to share the knowledge of articles you have read is to write a summary.

It serves two purposes :

* It gives visibility to non-technical persons involved in the project of what ways are being explored
* It helps your technical team members and yourself to dive into a topic without having to read the whole paper again

## Control Points

### Non technical summary

* [ ] I have the metadata of the article
  * [ ] A link to the paper. Check: the link is present
  * [ ] The date of the paper. Check: the date is present
  * [ ] The author\(s\) \(and if available the institute where they work\). Check: the author is present
* [ ] I express my opinion on why this article is/is not interesting for the project. Check: I have + and/or - bullets points
* [ ] I express my recommandation on what are the next steps \(e.g. implement the algorithm to set up an experiment, read another paper, ...\). Check: I have created tickets for the next steps
* [ ] I write a short summary with the key ideas and results of the article. Check: my agile coach understands the ideas expressed

### Technical summary

* [ ] If the article is interesting, the other developer \(the one that did not write the summary\) implements the algorithm. Check: The other developer\(s\) can implement the algorithm
