# \[Standard\] How to use conception tickets

### Owner: [Quentin Febvre](https://github.com/quentinf00)

## Why:

* To detect problem earlier during the implementation of a ticket
* To ensure visibility on what is done during the implementation of a ticket

This can be a tool to reduce the lead time on features with uncertainties, the conception phase can be used to prioritize kanban ticket into you sprint

## Checks

✅ I have detailed the ticket in tasks smaller than 15min  
✅ The tasks have been challenged by another dev of the team  
✅ The dev tracks the time spent on each tasks. \(You can use this tool on Trello: [https://theodo.github.io/workflow-monitor](https://theodo.github.io/workflow-monitor)\)  
✅ If the ticket was underestimated, the dev call the PO and ask to prioritize more points  
✅ If the ticket is not done by the end of the day, the dev split it and put the number of points consumed to validate
